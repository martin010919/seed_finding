Follow them, they are such a good devs, and do a lot to the
seed finding community.

========================================================================
seeds.txt contain ***5577*** 1.16.1 possible ssg seed
These are fsg seeds filtered with in combination with the
MineAChunkSeedfinder what I used to filter all the possible chunks
for close nether fortress at spawn. 
I used the Seed-Chunk-finder to find the best possible overworld.
Also the official fsg filter program for general good seeds.

They need to be tested, if I tested all 5577 possible
best seed I will update the github with it.
